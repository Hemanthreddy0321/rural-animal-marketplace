##  🐄 Rural Animal Marketplace

A web-based platform that connects rural animal sellers and buyers in a simple and secure way.
Farmers can list animals for sale, manage requests, and communicate directly with buyers, while buyers can explore listings, send requests, and chat after approval.

The platform focuses on transparency, ease of use, and digital access for rural markets.

## 📌 Overview

Rural Animal Marketplace is designed to digitize traditional rural animal trading.
Instead of depending on middlemen or physical markets, sellers can list animals online and buyers can directly connect with them through requests and in-app chat.

The platform ensures:

 - Controlled communication (only after request acceptance)

 - Price privacy until seller approval

 - Secure authentication using mobile number login

 - A smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices

This project aims to empower rural sellers, reduce dependency on brokers, and make animal trading more transparent and efficient.
